In the heat and sands of India, the flowers and swamps of Africa, the scandals of London, wherever the climate or the devil tempts humans to slip from the straight path that belongs to them, they are busy at this very moment lowering the prayer rugs, breaking the idols, and erecting their own grim faces instead.
His name is Hamkish Gardani.
Weak-willed people bring their own walls, love to influence, impose, praise and adorn their own gardens that have been adorned as common people.
In Hyde Park Corner, a preacher stands by a flowerpot and delivers a sermon.
Complicated in white uncle's twist, with the sign of repentance, wearing the disguise of brotherly love, walks the path in factories and legislative assemblies; offers help, but seeks power.
Opponents, or dissatisfied individuals, are pushed aside with violence from their path; he offers his good wishes to those who, with raised heads, obediently take the light of their eyes from his eyes.
This lady, Rosalind Warren Smith, found a place in William's heart, although she was hidden, as often happens in the guise of an unworthy and noble love, duty, and selflessness.
Ready to do whatever
What efforts it takes to secure financial resources, promote terminologies, and establish institutions.
But the all-powerful goddess of blood prefers the circle of stones over the clay and in the most delicate way, she spreads the will of humans on her feast table.
Its example led to its leadership.
Fifteen years had passed
There was nothing that could exactly be pinned on him, no scandal, no financial corruption, just a sinking into the depths of his own will, the whirlpool of William's will.
Her smile was sweet, her quick stride down Harley Street to the dinner at a restaurant with eight to nine stages of nourishment, fifteen guests from various specialties, soft and delicately alluring.
But a moment of the night that passed was a very brief and perhaps painful grip, a nervous twitch, a lingering confusion and disorientation that made something so unbelievably painful.
The poor lady was telling lies.
Long ago, freely and unrestrainedly, he used to go fishing for trout.
More tired and ready to serve the thirst for power, her husband's eyes sparkled with a greasy light, gathering, compressing, diminishing, grinding, and then sitting back, pulling her hair in a way that clearly indicated what had made that night unpleasant, and all this pressure had built up on her head, which could probably be attributed to professional conversations or the exhaustion of an excellent doctor whose life, as Lady put it, is not her own but belongs to her patients. The night became unpleasant.
As the guests struck ten o'clock, the atmosphere of Harley Street could be described as indescribably exciting, a comfort that, of course, deprived its patients of it.
Here is the translation of the sentence from Persian to English:

"In the gray room with paintings on the walls and expensive furniture under the frosted glass skylights, they observed his deviation bulletproof in the comfortable chairs, watching him make strange movements with his hands, quickly stretching them out, turning them rapidly to both sides of the aisles to prove that Sir William is in control of his affairs and not ill if the patient is stubborn."
This was where weak people fell apart, cried, and surrendered.
The rest, inspired by God, knew which extreme madness they faced William, they called him a cursed madman with even more arrogance in their own lives, how and why they did it.
Why should they stay alive at all?
William replied that life is his own.
Of course, Lady Bardshaw's chandelier was hanging with ostrich feathers on top, and even though she had a yearly income of twelve thousand, they were protesting.
But life has not bestowed such blessings upon us.
Accepted.
They had a good understanding of the proportionality of things.
English: Maybe, after all these words, there is no God involved at all?
She shrugged her shoulders.
Summary, but isn't this living or not living related to ourselves?
But they were mistaking this one.
William's friend in Sari had a skill that he taught there, which William honestly admitted was a difficult art.
Understanding the proportionality of things,
In addition, there was love for their own; nobility; courage; and a brilliant career.
All of these were firmly established in William's mind.
If they don't do anything
The police had to call on the support of the community leaders and the righteous to ensure peace of mind, they will take care of it in Sari, so that these anti-social movements, which mainly result from the lack of good upbringing and lineage, are controlled.
And then the goddess, who opposed subduing my desires, would break the unbreakable seal of her pure image in the realm of others, emerging from her hidden place and sitting on her throne.
The defenseless and helpless were the signs of William's will.
The attack was repelled.
I am swallowing.
People were suffocating.
It was this combination of determination, courage, and humanity that made William's head held high in the eyes of his relatives, who held his victims dear.
Emaratzia Warren Smith was walking down Harley Street shouting that she didn't like that man.
Hours on Harley Street were striking and dividing the day of June into pieces, recommending obedience, confirming authority, and at the same time reminding each other of the great benefits of understanding proportionality until the mass of time was so fragmented that a clock hanging over a shop on Oxford Street announced with kindness and brotherhood that it was half past one.
It seems Mr. Rigby and Lundiz are delighted with the free provision of this information.
Looking up, it seemed that every letter of their name was a place on the enemy's clock.
The semi-conscious man was grateful to Rugby and Londis when they informed him that he had reached Greenwich Mean Time.
Hugh Winterbottom was contemplating in front of the shop window, of course, afterwards he would go and buy rugby socks or shoes from Regby and Lundis.
