"in the heat and sands of India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance."
Conversion is her name
"she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace."
At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching;
"shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power;"
"smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own."
"This lady too Rezia Warren Smith divined it had her dwelling in Sir William's heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice."
How he would work
"how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions!"
"But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will."
"For example, Lady Bradshaw."
Fifteen years ago she had gone under.
"It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water logged, of her will into his."
"Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane."
"Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe"
that the poor lady lied.
"Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely:"
"now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband's eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, is not his own but his patients' disagreeable it was:"
"so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients."
"There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove if the patient was obstinate that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not."
"There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted;"
"others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself."
Why live?
Sir William replied that life was good.
"Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year."
"But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty."
He acquiesced.
They lacked a sense of proportion.
"And perhaps, after all, there is no God?"
He shrugged his shoulders.
"In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own?"
But there they were mistaken.
"Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art"
a sense of proportion.
"There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career."
All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion.
"If they failed him,"
"he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control."
"And then stole out from her hiding place and mounted her throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself."
"Naked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the impress of Sir William's will."
He swooped;
he devoured.
He shut people up.
It was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims.
"But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she did not like that man."
"Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs."
"Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was half past one."
"Looking up, it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours;"
subconsciously one was grateful to Rigby and Lowndes for giving one time ratified by Greenwich;
"this gratitude so Hugh Whitbread ruminated, dallying there in front of the shop window , naturally took the form later of buying off Rigby and Lowndes socks or shoes."
