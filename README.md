#### This is a research paper by our group based on the research paper Benchmarking Large Language Models for Persian: A Preliminary Study Focusing on ChatGPT by Ipouyall, AmirAbaskohi et al at the LREC-COLING 2024 conference held in Italy on May 20-25.
#### In the original, they mainly focus on GPT-3.5 (but somehow, they have used SOTA models also in it). However, we used not only GPT-3.5 (and GPT-4.0) but also Openchat (Llama the base. Some good some not, bruh) and Bloomz (Having very bruh results. I guess it's because of the dataset itself)
