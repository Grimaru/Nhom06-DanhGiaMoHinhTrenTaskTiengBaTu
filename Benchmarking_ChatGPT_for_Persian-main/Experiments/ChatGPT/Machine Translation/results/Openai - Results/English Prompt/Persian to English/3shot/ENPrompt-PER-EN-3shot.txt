In the heat and sands of India, the flowers and swamps of Africa, the scandals of London, wherever the climate or the devil tempts humans to slip from the straight path that is from him, even at this moment they are busy lowering the prayer rugs, smashing the idols, and erecting their grim faces instead.
His name is Homayoun.
Weak-willed people bring upon themselves the walls of their own making, loving to influence, impose, praise, and adorn their own ego, which has been popularly adorned.
In Hyde Park, a preacher stands on a pedestal and delivers a sermon.

This was where weak people fell apart, cried, and surrendered.

The defenseless and naked were a testament to the will of Sir William, accepting the fallen and the helpless.
The attack was repelled.
I am choking.
He was suffocating people.
It was this combination of determination and humanity that made William sacrifice himself so dearly in the eyes of his loved ones.
Emaratzia Warren Smith was walking down Harley Street shouting that she did not like that man.
The clocks on Harley Street were ticking and chiming, dividing and subdividing the day of June into teeth, recommending obedience, confirming authority, and at the same time reminding each other of the excellent benefits of proportionate understanding, until the mass of time was so cast down that a clock hanging over a shop on Oxford Street announced with kindness and brotherly love that it was half past one.
